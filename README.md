## Hi, I'm Alisher  
I'm a Software Engineer who loves building high-performance systems, experimenting with game mechanics, and working close to the metal.  
When I'm not busy - I'm probably prototyping weird ideas or optimizing something that didnâ€™t ask for it.

### Interests:
- Game development (mechanics, damage systems, simulation)
- Low-level optimization and system design
- AI logic and automation
- Lua, C#, Python

#### Also into:
- Mountain biking
- Physics, Math
- Training
